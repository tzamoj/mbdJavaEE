Reason to drop the listener on selectionProperty():
  Selecting with the mouse a part of the text leads to several (a lot) of modification on the selectionProperty(), which would trigger the listener, in turn sending data to the server, in turn sending notifications to all observers. This results in a huge waste of resource, and in a real situation would be terribly inefficient.
  As is implemented, there is no listener at all, and the selection is sent to the server only when an action such as cut is performed. A better solution would be to have a less excited listener, i.e. one that would send data to the server less frequently, allowing for multiple modification on selection to happen for a single trigger.
